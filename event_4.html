            <p>I have spent years taking handwritten notes, but now I do pretty much everything digitally using either my laptop or my iPad and so the question is which one of these methods is best.<p>
            <p>Handwritten notes pretty much got me through the years at school. I would write down important points from the PowerPoint presentations that the teacher would present on the smart board and take my own handwritten notes later when I reach home. Also, when the teachers send important notes, first I highlight the points which are the most relevant and I sort of annotate them as well. When the exams were approaching, I would waste no time and just go through all the notes that I have made so far. And to this day nothing has changed apart from the fact that now it's all digitized.</p>

            <p>Now I have the presentations that the teachers have sent, downloaded and stored on my iPad in an app called Notability. So, within the app I basically have all the tools I need to both annotate and highlight. This single iPad reduces so much paper and the apple pencil decreases the number of pencils and colour pencils. I have another app on my iPad known as Goodnotes 5 and this app sort of acts as a super notebook where I can jot down notes separate to the presentations. With Goodnotes I can take notes which are informative and aesthetically pleasing at the same time. I use pictures, different colours, different types of paper templates etc.</p>

            <p>I think it's crucial to choose study methods that are effective and efficient that can reduce the friction of studying and saves time when studying. This is something that I really want to do, and this is why I think taking digital notes is so key for me. There may be lots of evidence that shows that handwritten notes on paper are better than typed notes or digital handwritten notes when it comes to learning but I think digital notes have come so far since some of these studies have been done.</p>
            <p>I learnt that there's no wrong way of studying or way of writing notes, all methods are good as long as they help at least one person to understand the material, the only wrong method is to procrastinate all year and learn everything for a day and in my opinion maybe in a year from now I might change my studying techniques again who knows! I think being able to adapt and change to your surrounding circumstances is also really important.</p>
