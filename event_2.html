            <p>The Earth Day of 2019 was celebrated at DPS, Sharjah on Sunday, 21<sup>st</sup> April 2019. An array of creative activities were conducted in all classes from 6-12. The whole event revolved around the view of educating our students about what we have and what we are losing by acting in ways that aren't environment friendly or energy efficient with a significant reminder to all that we need to take action to protect our environment before it's too late.</p>
            <p>"No to plastic bags", one of the most significant slogan towards environmental protection was brought to action by our grade 6 students who had made paper bags. This program is further aiming for a community outreach by providing an opportunity to our students to interact with the workers in the nearby groceries and sensitize them on this eco-friendly method. To propagate the theme "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle", grade 7 students with their creative caps, made planters from waste materials.</p>
            <p>The big paper waste collected at the end of each academic year is of the half used notebooks of students. As a measure of reusing these left out pages of notebooks, girls and boys of grade 8 bound the pages to fresh notebooks and decorated the cover page giving it a new appearance. The students worked meticulously to create 5 such notebooks per section. A task which contributed to saving resource and henceforth saving this environment for the future also proved to be a lesson of a practical skill.</p>

            <p>Students were seen in excitement to learn something new, leaving a mark of difference on this annual event. The classrooms of grade 9 were fully engaged along with their teachers composing a pledge on Earth Day. This adorned their classroom walls against colourful backdrops. Student driven interactive quizzes on environment added fervor to the spirit of the day. Students made presentations on the topic: Dubai Govt. Sustainability Initiative on waste management for 2020 that aids the students to be innovative visionaries of the future.</p>
            <p>The Earth Day at DPS, Sharjah which predominantly focused on environmental concerns, proved to be very substantial for the learners to discern their responsibility towards the environment. It was a day of sprint action and awareness towards sustainability.</p>
            <p>Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it is the only thing that ever has. We here at DPS has always chosen to take a turn to that untrodden path which has made all the difference.</p>
